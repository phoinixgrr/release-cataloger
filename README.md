# Release Cataloger

Release Cataloger is a lightweight Go-based service designed to fetch, cache, and expose information about a GitHub Project's releases via a REST API.

Data are populated in runtime against Github API, and cached in Memory.

## Features üöÄ

- **Centralized Release Information**: Retrieves all release data directly from GitHub, ensuring GitHub remains the single source of truth, eliminating the need for separate databases and/or manual data entry.
- **REST API**: Provides a standardized API interface for seamless integration with various services and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Stateless Design**: The service is designed stateless, simplifying scaling and management.
- **Caching**: Cache release data in memory, serving data from this local cache at all times. A cron job periodically refreshes this cache to ensure data remains up-to-date.
- **Retry Logic**: gracefully handles failures when interacting with the GitHub API.
- **Filtering**: Supports basic filtering of releases by criteria such as RC, drafts, and prerelease versions.
- **Secure and Coordinated Refresh**: Manual cache refresh via a POST request to  route: `/refresh`, with functionality of updating all pods if running under k8s üöÄ. Access control is managed at the ALB level.
- **Kubernetes Ready**:
  - Stateless architecture for easy scaling.
  - `/refresh` logic, to propagate to all pods in the deployment
  - `/ready` endpoint for readiness probe
  - Prometheus metrics
  - Configuration through env variables.
  - Containerized

## API Routes üåê

- `GET /releases`: Fetch the cached list of releases.
    - `include-rc=true|false`: Include release candidates (default: false).
    - `include-draft=true|false`: Include draft releases (default: false).
    - `include-prerelease=true|false`: Include prerelease versions (default: false).
- `POST /refresh`: Manually refresh the releases. Usefull when integrating with a CI pipeline.
- `GET /ready`: Check if the server is ready.
- `GET /metrics`: Expose Prometheus metrics.

## Examples üí°

### Example 1: Fetching Releases

```bash
curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8080/releases" | jq
```
```json

[...]
```


### Example 2: Fetching Releases Including Prereleases and RC Versions
```bash
curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8080/releases?include-prerelease=true&include-rc=true" | jq
```
```json

[...]
```


## Metrics üìà

  - `requests_total`: Tracks the total number of API requests handled.
  - `requests_total_github_api`: Tracks the total number of requests made to the GitHub API.
  - `github_api_request_latency_seconds`: Observes the latency of GitHub API requests.
  - `local_server_request_latency_seconds`: Observes the latency of requests to the local server.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The following environment variables can be configured:

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                                                                 | Default Value |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `GITHUB_REPO`      | he GitHub repository in the format owner/repo (e.g., phoinixgrr/release-cataloger).                                                                                       | None   |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`       | The GitHub token used for authentication. This is optional, but highly recommended to be injected, since without it requests towards GitHub API will be subjected to rate limiting. A GitHub token with readonly repo scope is enough. | None          |
| `VERBOSITY_LEVEL`    | Sets the logging level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARN).                                                                                                           | INFO          |
| `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`    | The maximum number of retry attempts for fetching releases from the GitHub API.                                                                              | 5             |
| `INITIAL_DELAY`      | The initial delay before retrying a failed GitHub API request.                                                                                               | 2s            |
| `CRON_SCHEDULE`      | The cron schedule for refreshing the release data against GitHub API.                                                                                        | @every 24h    |

## ToDo

- Document the API using Swagger
- Better handling of /refresh propagation (master/slave election, state)
- Seperate the code in multiple files
- Tracing?!
- Grafana Dashboard
